# SMKS Korporasi Garut

## Thesis project

This project are developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and also using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the language.  
The purpose of this project is to fulfill my thesis project and also to facilitate SMKS Korporasi Garut's product distribution process.

## User Story

"We (SMKS Korporasi Garut) want to have something that can accommodate the product distribution process produced by SMKS Korporasi Garut. The current product distribution process is still using conventional methods, where we will distribute and/or sell our products door-to-door. Which is not as effective as we wanted. Besides that, SMKS Korporasi Garut still doesn't have its own official website, which is not relevant in this 'technology' era. So, we want to have an official website that has a page describing what SMKS Korporasi Garut is in as much detail as possible. Also, the main feature of the website is e-commerce, or a marketplace, to accommodate the product distribution process. The purpose of e-commerce is to gradually increase market share."
